# ibus-russian-elecom

Russian [ibus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus) layout for using a Japanese Elecom keyboard

I type in English, Russian and Japanese, all using a Japanese keyboard.
These are mostly like a regular US QWERTY keyboard, but with some exceptions, e.g. extra keys and non-letter characters in odd locations.

The existing ibus layouts for Russian don't seem to work well with this keyboard, so I made my own.
